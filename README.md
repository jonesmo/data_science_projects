# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repo contains a selection of data science projects I've completed and am working on.

### Communities and Violent Crime (Supervised Learning, Regression)
  * Methodically optimized OLS, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting models of U.S. Census, FBI, and LEMAS data around 2,000 U.S. communities to predict violent crime rates via regression, prioritizing interpretability
  * Narrowed feature space from 147 to 27 by automating assessment of colinearity using Python
  * Visualized results with matplotlib and seaborn
  * Best model achieved an R^2 value of 0.6

Languages & Libraries:

* Python 3.6.9
* Pandas 1.1.5
* Scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
